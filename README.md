# Chinese_Sentence_Diagnose

The program is designed to diagnose the healthy degree of any Chinese sentence. The definition of healthy here is that the input sentence does not have any cursing or dirty words. The program can automatically detect the dirty and cursing words in sentences and then calculate the percentage of the healthy degree of a sentence.
